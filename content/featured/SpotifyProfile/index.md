Designed RESTful APIs for an outdoor touring company (natours frontend application). I implemented APIs for:

1. User registration
2. User authentication & authorization
3. Updating user profile
4. Getting all Tours within a geolocation
5. Getting top 5 tours based on price, rating, and location
6. Writing user reviews on each tour experience
